# Is a my multiple project "Game-Life" in C++ and CMake

The **Game of Life**, also known as **Conway's Game of Life** or **simply Life**,
is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician *John Horton Conway* in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## This project not done yet, but i want add:
1. GUI with new window
2. choice of field size and world boundaries (whether the world is closed in itself or not (like Pac-Man)
3. user-specific conditions of life and death
4. screen scaling and debugging of the non-GUI terminal version
5. the speed of generation change and the ability to change them with clicks
6. random cell display generator at the start of the game / custom positions by user
7. loading fiends from system files ( i think the best idea is bool massive )
* **Have fun!** (Kislyy MiyoTize 0_.)
